# UMBC C++ Coding Standards Autogenerator
## By Evan Rittenhouse
Allows UMBC students to easily and quickly create C or C++ projects with a single script according to the Spring 2015 C++ coding standards.

###Features:
* Automatically creates Driver.cpp to run program.
* Automatically creates makefile with useful rules
  * ```make all```- compiles and links all files generated by the autogenerator into Driver.out
  * ```make *file.o*```- compiles an unlinked version of \*file.cpp\* and \*file.h\*
  * ```make clean```- removes typical leftover files during builds.
  * ```make todo```- lists all TODO comments in .cpp and .h files and on what lines
  * ```make run```- compiles and runs the full program
* Creates .cpp, .c, and .h files, filling in information the script can easily scrape from the UMBC GL server and creating skeleton classes where necessary.
  * Adds rules to makefile upon creation of .cpp or .c files
  * [NEW] now only requests project information upon first invocation
  * Changes Driver.c/Driver.cpp #include directives based on filetype

###Installation:
Run these commands in your home directory on the UMBC GL server:
```
git clone https://github.com/emanguy/UMBC-codegen.git
cd UMBC-codegen
./install.sh
```

###Execution:
In the src directory where you're going to write your project files, execute the command ```cppbuild```, then follow the prompts.

###Bash users:
If you're using bash on a linux system other than the UMBC GL servers, please check the code out from the ```bash-shell``` branch rather than master.
