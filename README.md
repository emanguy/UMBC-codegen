# UMBC C++ Coding Standards Autogenerator
## By Evan Rittenhouse
Allows UMBC students to easily and quickly create C++ projects with a single script according to the Spring 2015 C++ coding standards.

Features:
* Automatically creates Driver.cpp to run program.
* Automatically creates makefile with useful rules
  * make all- compiles and links all files generated by the autogenerator into Driver.out
  * make *file.o*- compiles an unlinked version of *file.cpp* and *file.h*
  * make clean- removes typical leftover files during builds.
  * make todo- lists all TODO comments in .cpp and .h files and on what lines
  * make run- compiles and runs the full program
* Creates .cpp and .h files, filling in information the script can easily scrape from the UMBC GL server and creating skeleton classes where necessary.
  * Adds rules to makefile upon creation of .cpp files
